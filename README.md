# Hi, I am [Brayden Rayner](https://github.com/bcer-dev) ðŸ‘‹
## About Me
My name is Brayden, and I'm a high-school student in Canada. I have a strong interest in computer-science and mathematics, and enjoy building big and small projects in my spare time. I would like to complete a Master of Computer Science in university, and become a machine learning engineer, software engineer, or embedded software engineer.

## Languages
<p>The programming languages I use most are C, C++, C#, and Python depending on what kind of project I am making. I have also used JavaScript, Java, and more.</p>
