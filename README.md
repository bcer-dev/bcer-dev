## About Me
My name is Brayden Rayner. I am a Canadian high-school student and self-taught programmer. The languages I am best with are C and C++, but I have worked with other languages in the past, such as Python, C# (with Unity) and JavaScript. In my free time, I enjoy working on coding challenges and side-projects. I am also interested in mathematics and physics.
